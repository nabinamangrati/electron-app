Basic setup for an Electron app.

## Steps

- Created local and remote GitHub repo  
- Ran `npm init` and filled config 
-This sets up your package.json file — the heart of your Node.js/Electron project — which tracks dependencies, scripts, and metadata. 
- Installed Electron with `npm install --save-dev electron`  
- Added `"start": "electron ."` in `package.json`  
- Created `main.js` with a test `console.log()`  
- Ran `npm run start` to test – message printed in terminal
